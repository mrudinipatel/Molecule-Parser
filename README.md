# Molecule-Parser âš›

This full-stack program simulates a molecule visualizer that allows users to upload and view chemical spatial data files (.sdf files). The program also allows users to modify atom features in the display such as colour, gradient, and radius size. This program is hosted through a Python webserver and can be used through browsers.

### To Launch ðŸš€

1. Clone/download this repository on your local computer
2. Open a terminal window in your cloned repository.
3. Run ```make```. This should generate ```molecule_wrap.c``` and ```molecule.py``` files, along with some .o (object) and .so (library) files.
4. To locate .so libraries in your computer, run ```export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.```
5. Run ```python3 server.py 8080```
6. In a browser of choice (i.e., Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc), run ```http://localhost:8080```
7. To exit program in terminal, run ```ctrl + c```

Please note, you may need to modify the python library pathways inside the makefile to compile the program. You may also need to change the python version in step 5 to match the version installed on your computer. You may also change the port number as desired.

### Tech Stack ðŸ§®
- **Backend:** C, Python, makefile
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, AJAX, HTML5, CSS3
- **Misc:** SDF files, preprocessor (.i) files

### Future Improvements ðŸ”®
In the future, it would be nice to add security features to the webserver such as data encryption and user authentication to maintain user privacy and prevent the program from being exploited.
